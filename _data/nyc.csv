manhole,Empire City Subway ,/img/nyc/manholes/ecs.png,"Empire City Subway was formed in 1891 to construct and maintain tubes for telegraph and telephone cables ('subway' referring to anything under the ground, not just transportation networks). ECS now leases space in those conduits to telecommunications companies. They own approximately 11,000 manholes and 58 million feet of conduit. The New York Telephone Company (also known as Bell Atlantic New York) was ECS' original primary shareholder. Through the dark alchemy of mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry, ECS is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon.",,,
manhole,Time Warner Cable,/img/nyc/manholes/twc.png,"Time Warner Cable as we know it began its existence in 1992. They launched one of the first high speed cable internet services in 1996 before separating from its parent company, Time Warner, in 2009. Time Warner Cable's franchise agreement with the city of New York dates back to 1997, so presumably these manhole covers appeared sometime between 1997 and now. ",,,
manhole,Level 3 Communications,/img/nyc/manholes/l3.png,"Level 3 Communications began trading on NASDAQ in 1998 and received its franchise to build a fiber optic network in New York City in 1999. They are a major Tier 1 network, which means that their network has a direct connection to every other network online without paying fees to do so. In 2012, Level 3 received a $411 million contract from the Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to provide fiber cable and maintenance support to DoD networks. This is just something that is interesting to know. ",,,

It is unclear if a cable marked ""RCN"" is actually a cable that belongs to RCN because of some mergers & acquisitions dark magic that happened over the last few years. Currently, RCN has a franchise agreement with the city as an ""open video system"". This is different from a cable provider, but the franchise agreements are pretty similar. In 2001, Con Edison announced that they were creating their own fiber optic network, managed by the holding company Con Edison Communications. In 2006, RCN acquired Con Edison Communications for $32 million. RCN was acquired by private equity firm Abry Partners in 2010, which repackaged and rebranded its metro area operations (which managed the former Con Ed fiber network) as Sidera Networks.

Icahn orchestrated a massive 2008 refinancing of XO's debt (90% of which Icahn owns) and took the company private in 2011. XO's minority shareholders have accused Icahn of using XO's financial losses as tax benefits for other companies Icahn owns. A lawsuit brought in 2009 by these shareholders is ongoing. ",,,
streetmarking,FO,/img/nyc/mark/fo.png,"FO indicates a fiber optic cable. A novice street marking reader might assume it refers to Verizon FiOs, but ""fiber optic"" doesn't necessarily mean what we think of as ""internet""--private companies maintain their own networks, as do city agencies and institutions. And lots of things can run over fiber-VoIP, television, and the internet can all run over fiber cables. In general, where you see telephone cables, you'll also see other kinds of cables, including fiber. ",,,

Formed as a corporation under the Bell Telephone Company to build a nationwide long-distance network, AT&T's first network connected Chicago and New York in 1892. While this field guide might not be the place for AT&T and the Bell System's voluminous history, traces of that history are all over New York City in buildings like the Long Lines building at 33 Thomas Street, a switching center at 811 Tenth Avenue, and its former Long Lines building at 32 Avenue of the Americas, now a major convergence and colocation center for networks.",,,
antennas,Traffic Signal Controllers,/img/nyc/boxes/traffic-box.png,"<p>
These dark green signal control boxes attached to traffic signal posts are just one piece of a massive system of networked objects. The system, designed by the North Carolina-based transit services company TransitScore, combines data collected by real-time traffic cameras, RFID (radio frequency identification) scanners, and other field sensors to create traffic signal times that adapt to the immediate conditions of traffic. Each signal control box contains wireless routing equipment and traffic controllers that connect back to a fiber hub. The little green dome on top of the signal control is actually a powerful wireless router used  for communicating with the other sensors in the traffic network and the city’s Traffic Management Center in Long Island City.
</p><p>
This system, initially piloted in 2011 and slowly rolled out to the city’s over 12,500 traffic signals, relies heavily on NYCWiN, the city-wide broadband wireless network project initially created for emergency first responders. Construction of the network began in 2006 under a $500 million contract with defense contractor Northrop Grumman ($20 million of which came from a DHS grant), and the network  became operational in 2009. Many regarded the project as a failure given its limited use (primarily by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Protection rather than law enforcement) and exorbitant cost (around $40 million annually just to maintain). The city tried to sell the network back to Northrop Grumman in 2011, but the contractor didn’t want it.
</p><p>
Despite NYCWin’s shortcomings supporting law enforcement, their use in the city’s traffic systems has made it fantastically easy to share traffic data with law enforcement rapidly and seamlessly.

antennas,Distributed Antenna Systems,/img/nyc/boxes/DAS.png,"A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is basically a way to expand a cell network's reach, adding capacity in under-covered areas. They're a little easier to find on the street because they're not on top of buildings--they're attached to street poles and linked to underground fiber-optic networks. If you ever see an orange cable marking going into a street pole, look up. You'll probably see a DAS. There are 7 companies with franchise agreements to maintain Distributed Antenna Systems in New York; however, 3 of those companies appear to belong to one company (Crown Castle) and 2 appear to be subsidiaries of the same company (ExteNet Systems). ",,,
antennas,Subway Wifi Devices,/img/nyc/boxes/subwaywifi.png,"In 2007, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) began working with contractor Transit Wireless on building out a fiber-optic network to support wifi access on subway platforms. The system works similarly to a DAS--signals from wireless carrier base stations are converted by Transit Wireless into optical signals, which are sent to RF nodes in individual stations. The RF node then distributes that signal to antennae in the station. The pilot program began trials in 2011. As of summer 2014, 47 of the city's 278 stations had wifi access. 
",,,
antennas,Cell Towers,/img/nyc/boxes/celltowers.png,"If you're connecting to the internet when you're out in the world, you're probably connecting to a cellular wireless network. Seeing the internet on the street, for many, just means using a smartphone. Those phones connect to networks via cell towers. Generally, these are pretty hard to see from the street--they're mostly on tops of buildings. They're also often disguised, although their New York disguises (bricks on buildings) are pretty simple compared to cell tower disguises in other places (trees, church crosses, cacti). ",,,
cameras,Traffic Cameras,/img/nyc/cameras/trafficcamera.png,"<p>Many intersections in New York City have a horizontally polarized panel antenna (the device on the left in the illustration above). These devices broadcast and receive radio signals. In this context, they’re used to read radio frequency identification (RFID) devices embedded in EZ-Pass devices. Technically EZ-Pass is used for toll collection, but these and other sensor devices collect data from RFIDs for traffic monitoring purposes.</p><p>

The city Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) operate traffic cameras at, respectively, 723 intersections and 20 bridge and tunnel entrances. The DOT cameras have video streams that can be viewed at <a href=http://nyctmc.org>www.nyctmc.org</a>. ",,,

Data collected by cameras feeds back to MTA Rail Control Centers, located in various parts of the city. ",,,
