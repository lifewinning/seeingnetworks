manhole,Empire City Subway ,/img/nyc/manholes/ecs.png,"Empire City Subway was formed in 1891 to construct and maintain tubes for telegraph and telephone cables ('subway' referring to anything under the ground, not just transportation networks). ECS now leases space in those conduits to telecommunications companies. They own approximately 11,000 manholes and 58 million feet of conduit. The New York Telephone Company (also known as Bell Atlantic New York) was ECS' original primary shareholder. Through the dark alchemy of mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry, ECS is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon.",
manhole,Time Warner Cable,/img/nyc/manholes/twc.png,"Time Warner Cable as we know it began its existence in 1992. They launched one of the first high speed cable internet services in 1996 before separating from its parent company, Time Warner, in 2009. Time Warner Cable's franchise agreement with the city of New York dates back to 1997, so presumably these manhole covers appeared sometime between 1997 and now. ",
manhole,Level 3 Communications,/img/nyc/manholes/l3.png,"Level 3 Communications began trading on NASAQ in 1998 and received its franchise to build a fiber optic network in New York City in 1999. They are a major Tier 1 network, which means that their network has a direct connection to every other network online without paying fees to do so. In 2012, Level 3 received a $411 million contract from the Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to provide fiber cable and maintenance support to DoD networks. This is just something that is interesting to know. ",
manhole,Handholes,/img/nyc/manholes/handhole-verizon.png,"are structures set below ground that protect telecommunications cables, providing convenient access for splicing or pulling cable. You have probably walked by lots of pull boxes before and not really know what they do. ",
streetmarking,CATV,/img/nyc/mark/catv.png,What it sounds like—cable television.,
streetmarking,NXTG,/img/nyc/mark/nxtg.png,"NextG Networks received a franchise agreement in 2008 to install wireless infrastructure on city-owned poles for their distributed antenna system (DAS--see Distributed Antenna System in Cell Towers). The agreement also permits the company to install fiber below ground “for purposes of connecting Base Stations installed on Street Poles to one another or to a supporting telecommunications system.”  These fiber markings are often near street poles or emerging from street poles. In 2011, NextG was acquired by mobile infrastructure company Crown Castle International. ",
streetmarking,T,/img/nyc/mark/t.png,Telephone cables (presumably copper or coaxial.),
streetmarking,Shallow Cable,/img/nyc/mark/shallow.png,This means basically what it sounds like--the cable underground isn't very deep below the pavement. Possibly linked to microtrenching.,
streetmarking,ECS,/img/nyc/mark/ecs.png,"Sign of Empire City Subway ducts. which hold cables belonging to a variety of different companies for a variety of different uses (telephone, television, internet).",
streetmarking,RCN,/img/nyc/mark/rcn.png,"RCN is an internet service provider and a television cable provider. They're the 10th-largest ISP in the country. It is unclear if a cable marked ""RCN"" is actually a cable that belongs to RCN because of some mergers & acquisitions dark magic that happened over the last few years. Currently, RCN has a franchise agreement with the city as an ""open video system"". This is different from a cable provider, but the franchise agreements are pretty similar. In 2001, Con Edison announced that they were creating their own fiber optic network, managed by the holding company Con Edison Communications. In 2006, RCN acquired Con Edison Communications for $32 million. RCN was acquired by private equity firm Abry Partners in 2010, which repackaged and rebranded its metro area operations (which managed the former Con Ed fiber network) as Sidera Networks. Sidera merged with Lightower Networks in 2013, after both companies were acquired by Berkshire Partners in 2012. ",
streetmarking,MCI,/img/nyc/mark/mci.png,The telecommunications company currently owned by Verizon.,
streetmarking,L3,/img/nyc/mark/l3.png,"Level 3 Communications, an internet service provider.",
streetmarking,XO,/img/nyc/mark/xo.png,"XO Communications was founded in 1994 and, like many network providers that built fiber-optic networks during the first tech bubble, experienced financial meltdown in the early 2000s. It emerged from bankruptcy in 2003 with well-known activist shareholder Carl Ichan as its majority shareholder and board chairman. Ichan orchestrated a massive 2008 refinancing of XO's debt (90% of which Ichan owns) and took the company private in 2011. XO's minority shareholders have accused Ichan of using XO's financial losses as tax benefits for other companies Ichan owns. A lawsuit brought in 2009 by these shareholders is ongoing. ",
streetmarking,FO,/img/nyc/mark/fo.png,"FO indicates a fiber optic cable. A novice street marking reader might assume it refers to Verizon FiOs, but ""fiber optic"" doesn't necessarily mean what we think of as ""internet""--private companies maintain their own networks, as do city agencies and institutions. And lots of things can run over fiber-VoIP, television, and the internet can all run over fiber cables. In general, where you see telephone cables, you'll also see other kinds of cables, including fiber. ",
streetmarking,ATT,/img/nyc/mark/att.png,"AT&T has been a presence in New York City since the first cable ducts were organized under Consolidated Telegraph & Electrical Subway Co. Formed as a corporation under the Bell Telephone Company to build a nationwide long-distance network, AT&T's first network connected Chicago and New York in 1892. While this field guide might not be the place for AT&T and the Bell System's voluminous history, traces of that history are all over New York City in buildings like the Long Lines building at 33 Thomas Street, a switching center at 811 Tenth Avenue, and its former Long Lines building at 32 Avenue of the Americas, now a major convergence and colocation center for networks.",
antennas,Distributed Antenna Systems,/img/nyc/boxes/das.png,"A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is basically a way to expand a cell network's reach, adding capacity in under-covered areas. They're a little easier to find on the street because they're not on top of buildings--they're attached to street poles and linked to underground fiber-optic networks. If you ever see an orange cable marking going into a street pole, look up. You'll probably see a DAS. There are 7 companies with franchise agreements to maintain Distributed Antenna Systems in New York; however, 3 of those companies appear to belong to one company (Crown Castle) and 2 appear to be subsidiaries of the same company (ExteNet Systems). ",
antennas,Subway Wifi Devices,/img/nyc/boxes/subwaywifi.jpg,"In 2007, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) began working with contractor Transit Wireless on building out a fiber-optic network to support wifi access on subway platforms. The system works similarly to a DAS--signals from wireless carrier base stations are converted by Transit Wireless into optical signals, which are sent to RF nodes in individual stations. The RF node then distributes that signal to antennae in the station. The pilot program began trials in 2011. As of summer 2014, 47 of the city's 278 stations had wifi access. 
",
antennas,Cell Towers,/img/nyc/boxes/celltowers.png,"Increasingly when out and about in the world, people connect to the internet through wireless networks. Seeing the internet on the street, for many, just means using a smartphone. Those phones connect to networks via cell towers. Generally, these are pretty hard to see from the street--they're mostly on tops of buildings. They're also often disguised, although their New York disguises (bricks on buildings) are pretty simple compared to cell tower disguises in other places (trees, church crosses, cacti). ",
cameras,Speed Cameras,/img/nyc/cameras/speedcamera.jpg,"As of September 2014 there are 140 speed cameras in school zones in New York City, following state legislation. These are designated for areas within a quarter mile of any city school. The cameras are under the purview of the city Department of Finance, as they issue the actual speeding tickets. ",
cameras,Traffic Cameras,/img/nyc/cameras/trafficcamera.jpg,"The city Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) operate traffic cameras at, respectively, 723 intersections and 20 bridge and tunnel entrances. The DOT cameras have video streams that can be viewed at www.nyctmc.org. ",
cameras,MTA Cameras,/img/nyc/cameras/mtacamera.jpg,"It's unclear exactly when the MTA began installing closed-circuit television cameras on some subway platforms, but their efforts to expand that camera network ramped up dramatically after September 11, 2001. The MTA has 4,313 cameras operating throughout the transit system, with 1,576 cameras on city buses. Data collected by cameras feeds back to MTA Rail Control Centers, located in various parts of the city. ",
cameras,NYPD Cameras,/img/nyc/cameras/nypdcamera.jpg,"The New York City Police Department has a few thousand labeled surveillance cameras in their Argus program. I don't have an exact number. They wouldn't tell me when I filed a Freedom of Information request because having a list of all the camera locations would encourage crime. As this is not a field guide to the labyrinth of insanity that is NYPD's FOIL policies, perhaps we should not discuss the matter further. ",
cameras,CrimeEye Cameras,/img/nyc/cameras/crimeeyecamera.jpg,"I've only seen these cameras in lower Manhattan, and pretty much only around federal buildings. They appear to belong to the Department of Homeland Security, and are manufactured by a company named Total Recall Corporation. (Not even joking.) ",
cameras,Private Cameras,/img/nyc/cameras/privatecamera.jpg,"Most private cameras connect to a larger network for a single building's security system. Some (at least 2,000) feed into the NYPD's Domain Awareness System.",
