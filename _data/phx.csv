manhole,Empire City Subway ,/img/nyc/manholes/ecs.png,"Empire City Subway was formed in 1891 to construct and maintain tubes for telegraph and telephone cables ('subway' referring to anything under the ground, not just transportation networks). ECS now leases space in those conduits to telecommunications companies. They own approximately 11,000 manholes and 58 million feet of conduit. The New York Telephone Company (also known as Bell Atlantic New York) was ECS' original primary shareholder. Through the dark alchemy of mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry, ECS is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon.",,,
