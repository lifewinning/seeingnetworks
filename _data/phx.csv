pedestals,Cable TV & Internet,/img/phx/pedestals/cable.png,"Cox provides TV, Internet, and digital phone service to the entire metro area, primarily to residential areas but to some commercial areas as well. These pedestals are mostly just for passive junctions.",,,
pedestals,Phone & DSL (Neighborhood),/img/phx/pedestals/telco-neighborhood.png,"CenturyLink provides phone and DSL service to the entire metro area -- formerly Qwest, formerly U S WEST, formerly Mountain Bell, formerly Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph and part of the original American Bell Telephone Company. These neighborhood-sized pedestals can be powered and translate fiber optic lines into hundreds of copper lines running to each street.",,,
pedestals,Phone & DSL (Roadside),/img/phx/pedestals/telco-road.png,"These roadside pedestals can serve as junctions for 100 individual lines or more, and connect neighborhood or street lines to each building. In some older markets where cable has taken over, the cover can sometimes be seen falling off or patch block hanging out of the pedestal, but normally they are locked with bolts that require a special tool to open.",,,
pedestals,Phone & DSL (Building-side),/img/phx/pedestals/telco-home.png,"These wall-mounted boxes demarcate phone-company-owned wires from building-owned wires and facilitate the connection between them. Usually the company-owned side is locked to prevent customer access.",,,
pedestals,Buried Fiber Optic Cable,/img/phx/pedestals/fiber.png,"Often spotted near the intersection of railroad tracks and streets, on side streets adjacent to major arterial roads, or along highways, these simply alert residents to the presence of fiber optic cables buried below. Backhoes are the sworn enemy of buried cable since they can slice through cables and even pipes without noticing, so ""call before you dig"" signage is very common around buried cable and pipe. Fiber is the preferred medium for communications that need to travel more than a few miles.",,,
pedestals,Light Rail,/img/phx/pedestals/rail.png,"Electrical and data cabinets at each light rail station to collect camera, digital signage, audio announcement, and track sensor wiring and transmit it to the operations control center located across from the Van Buren and 1st Ave station. Along the route are 144 strands of fiber optic cable providing gigabit Ethernet, plus another 144 strands for traffic signals.",,,
pedestals,Highway Traffic Monitoring,/img/phx/pedestals/traffic.png,"The Arizona Department of Transportation operates sensors and cameras in and above the highway to monitor traffic conditions. The signals are collected and processed by equipment in these phonebooth-sized cabinets, and transmitted back to the control center via fiber optic cables. Not to be confused with similar-looking cabinets alongside railroad tracks.",,,
antennas,Traffic Sensors,/img/phx/antennas/traffic-sensing.png,"Overhead sensors complement in-pavement sensors to detect cars for traffic management, wrong-way-driver detection, and automated signage activation.",,,
antennas,Weather Stations,/img/phx/antennas/weather.png,"Used for everything from Salt River Project canal monitoring to airport operations, these stations monitor wind speed, direction, precipitation, humidity and more, solar-powered, and transmit its data over radio and the Internet. Many stations broadcast over the APRS network, which can be accessed via HAM radio and online.",,,
antennas,Cellphone Towers,/img/phx/antennas/cell-tower.png,"Identifiable by the multiple vertical panels usually arranged in a triangle or on the sides of buildings, each panel is a directional antenna which points into the center of a hexagonal cell. This arrangement provides good coverage of a highly-populated area without requiring a large antenna in the center of the area, which makes antenna placement easier. Often the builder of the tower uses the top tier and leases out the lower tiers to competitors, while either owning or leasing the land the tower is on.",,,
antennas,Microwave Point-to-Point Antennas,/img/phx/antennas/microwave.png,"Looking like large wedding cakes, speaker cones, or satellite dishes, the fabric or plastic covering prevents debris and moisture from getting into the metal antenna, which often just consists of the cylindrical metal sides and rear of the unit. Each antenna is directional and often pointed at a business's satellite office or a tall hill or building for relay purposes. Also used by television stations for live reporting from broadcast trucks which have their own dishes. Often seen at TV news stations, schools, hospitals, banks, and on hilltops.",,,
antennas,Municipal WiFi,/img/phx/antennas/muni-wifi.png,"Seen mostly around college campuses, city buildings, and downtown areas, on streetlight poles. Also used for cameras. Some are remnants of the now-defunct WAZ Tempe network. The three antennas are needed to both provide coverage to the immediate area and connect to nearby antennas to form a mesh.",,,
