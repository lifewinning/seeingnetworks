Manhole Covers,manhole,"Manhole covers are one point of entry into the city's underground world, and their designs indicate what part of that world they connect to. Here are some manhole covers that might help you identify pieces of the Internet."
Street Markings,streetmarking,"Sometimes you'll see a manhole cover that is surrounded with colorful markings. Whenever a contractor or construction company plans to do street excavation, utility companies will mark out the location of their underground cables so that the contractor knows to watch out for them. 
</h2><h2>
There's a federal color-code standard for sidewalk markings. Sometimes the contractors follow it, sometimes they don't, but it's useful to know.

Orange refers to the broad catch-all of ""Communications, alarm, signal lines, cables and conduit."" This means that orange lines can be internet cables, television cables, telephone lines, or other kinds of conduits.

Red means electricity, yellow means gas, green means sewer, and blue means water.

The markings are sometimes really sloppy, and often in fragments. Sometimes you'll see several different labels in the same place."
Pedestals,pedestals,"Pedestals are structures usually on the roadside or side of buildings where cables can be rewired as the network grows or as customers disconnect their service: like visible, above-the-surface manholes."
Various Antennas,antennas,"Wireless communication can be a great way to get information across town without digging or telephone poles, and can also make remote sensors cost effective via radio or cell-phone communication."
Sightseeing,places,"There are a few well-known locations that people tend to go to when they want to ""see the internet"" in Phoenix. Of course, there are plenty of not-so-famous buildings that store lots of data and connect networks to each other. Identifying these buildings when looking on the street is not always easy, but one telltale sign is to look for ventilation and cooling systems; computers generate a lot of heat. Alternatively, look for windows, or more accurately, the absence of them. Computers don't need to see! (Note: on much larger buildings, in particular skyscrapers, vents also could just be a sign of a mechanical floor, the centralized space dedicated to maintaining utility needs for the entire building.)

While this is by no means an exhaustive list, these are a few interesting starting points from which you can start looking. "
