An online field guide to network infrastructure is an OK way to share information about infrastructure, but when you are out in the world actually seeing infrastructure maybe you don't want to pull up some website on your phone.

So, here's a book. The book has lots of cool extra things that aren't on this website, like lengthy narratives about the NYPD's surveillance apparatus and high-frequency trading. If you're into those sorts of things, you might like this book!
