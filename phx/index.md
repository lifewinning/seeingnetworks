Phoenix's network infrastructure is both sprawling (from dense downtowns to the suburbs) and yet impressive (Phoenix is a prime location for datacenters, owing to its lack of natural disasters, proximity to the West Coast and Midwest, low land cost, and low nuclear-powered electricity cost. It's also home to a number of corporate regional headquarters and call centers.)
